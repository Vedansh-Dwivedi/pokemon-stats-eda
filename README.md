# pokemon-stats-eda
Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset of 721 Pokémon using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

## Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset of 721 Pokémon.  
The goal is to analyze statistical patterns, visualize attribute distributions, and understand relationships between features such as Attack, Defense, Speed, Type, and Legendary status. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook using Python.

---

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Explore distributions and relationships between Pokémon attributes  
- Visualize patterns using statistical plots  
- Compare Legendary vs. non-Legendary Pokémon  
- Summarize data-driven insights from the analysis

## Tools and Technologies
| Category | Libraries / Tools |
|----------|-------------------|
| Programming | Python |
| Data Analysis | Pandas, NumPy |
| Visualization | Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| Environment | Jupyter Notebook |

---

## Project Workflow
1. Load and inspect the dataset  
2. Clean data and handle inconsistencies  
3. Generate statistical summaries  
4. Create visualizations and correlation analysis  
5. Interpret findings and insights  

---

## Key Findings (Example)
- Significant differences in stats between Pokémon types  
- Legendary Pokémon show higher averages across most attributes  
- Strong correlations observed between Attack, Sp. Attack, and overall stats  
- Speed distribution shows clear variation across specific types  

(Your notebook visuals and outputs will support these findings.)
